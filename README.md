# Constellation
Constellation is a personal project to automate my house. 

## Rough outline

* Use Home Assistent as basis
* Wire movement sensors and smoke alarmas with Konnected
* Integrate cameras
* Add power sensor to washing machine and setup alerts
* Add component to send text-to-voice through Alexa
* Push alerts to phones


## Future

* Analyse images / short fragments with motion through a local ML solution to annotate who/what is on these images
* Emergency lighting when the smoke alarm goes in the main path (stairs) to outside.

## Questions that were never asked

### Why constellation?
 All computers in my house are named after planets and natural phenomena that are simultaneous Roman/Greek gods. Through this project these components will form a pattern - a constellation.

### Why answer questions that were never asked?
I like to explain why I am super clever.

### Constellations consist of stars. Not planets.
Not a question?

### Don't constellations consist of stars, not planets?
You're right, so my naming policy is not totally consistent.
